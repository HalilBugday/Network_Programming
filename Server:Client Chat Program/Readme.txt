This is a Server/Client chat program. The IP address (127.0.0.1) and port number (2222) are embedded in the code. Please do not try to enter it manually in the terminal. Please activate the server first.

sample terminal code:

--> gcc -o server Server.c
--> ./server

another terminal:

--> gcc -o client Client.c
--> ./client

and now you can start chatting.

It was a good semester, thanks sir! :)
